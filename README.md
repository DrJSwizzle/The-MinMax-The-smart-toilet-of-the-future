Our Smart Toilet project aims to revolutionize precision nutrition by delivering personalized dietary recommendations to users. By utilizing state-of-the-art analytical equipment, such as HPLC, GC, FTIR and others, as well as data from lifestyle tracking devices (smartwatch Fitbit etc), our data integration software will be able to analyze body tissue and fluids to determine nutritional deficiencies and make recommendations for improvement.

With user privacy being our number one priority, we guarantee that no personal user data will be collected or stored at any point in our process. Our software will be designed to strictly adhere to data privacy regulations, ensuring that all user data is protected and secure.

As a non-profit and open-source initiative, our goal is to improve the average intelligence and quality of life for the human population, and eventually, our animal friends as well. We are currently in the prototype phase and are actively seeking collaboration from experts in programming, medical science, mechanical engineering, business development, and internet security to bring this project to fruition.

Join us on our journey to improve health and well-being for all, and make a positive impact on the world."
