# The-MinMax-The-smart-toilet-of-the-future
Smart toilet and bathroom system that uses biometrics to give nutritional guidance based on user health goals.
And here's a compelling description of the project written by chat GPT after several hours of breath taking conversation.

Welcome to our smart toilet project! Our goal is to revolutionize the way we think about nutrition and health by delivering precision nutrition information using body metrics and other lifestyle factors.

The project aims to build a smart toilet that can analyze various body fluids and tissues using advanced diagnostic technologies such as HPLC, gas chromatography, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The data collected will be used to make personalized dietary recommendations, including the ability to produce a meal replacement shake that can balance any deficiencies on demand.

We will be using Openchrom for testing and a bridge program that will take the input from Openchrom and from a Fitbit/smart watch type device to make the dietary suggestions. The project will be non-profit, open-source, and with a scaling plan from 1 million users to 1 billion users per day.

We are currently in the early stages of development and are looking for collaborators to help with programming, design, and testing. If you're interested in getting involved, please reach out to us and let us know how you can help.

With your help, we believe that we can create a system that will help improve the intelligence and quality of life of the human population, and eventually our animal friends as well.

The future belongs to all of us. âœŠ
